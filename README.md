# Boulder Caves [frozen]
A Boulder Dash (tm) clone in pure python. Includes a cave editor so you can make your own game!


**Repository frozen - no more updates here:**
Someone else started an improved version of this game here
https://github.com/Agetian/bouldercaves - use that instead to get fixes and new features.




Requirements to run this:
- Python 3.6 or newer
- ``pillow`` (to deal with images)
- ``synthplayer`` (software FM synthesizer)
- one of the supported audio playback libraries:
    - ``miniaudio``
    - ``soundcard``
    - ``sounddevice``
    - ``pyaudio``

*Detailed instructions how to run the game are [at the bottom of this text.](#how-to-install-and-run-this-game)*

Much technical info about Boulder Dash can be found here https://www.elmerproductions.com/sp/peterb/
and here https://www.boulder-dash.nl/


There are a few command line options to control the graphics of the game, the zoom level,
and the graphics update speed (fps).
On Linux the game runs very well, on Windows and Mac OS it can have some troubles. 
If you experience graphics slowdown issues or the game prints that it cannot refresh
the screen fast enough, try adjusting the parameters on the command line.

Here is a [demo gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMvRBM28OP4) that shows what the
game looks, sounds and plays like.


## Objective and rules of the game

- Collect enough diamonds to open the exit to go to the next level!
- Extra diamonds grant bonus points, and time left is added to your score as well.
- Avoid monsters or use them to your advantage.
- Some brick walls are not simply what they seem. 
- Amoeba grows and grows but it is often worthwhile to contain it. Sometimes you have
  to set it free first.
- Slime is permeable to boulders and diamonds but you cannot go through it yourself.  
- *Intermission* levels are bonus stages where you have one chance to complete them.
You won't lose a life here if you die, but you only have one attempt at solving it.
- A small high score table is saved. 


## Controls

You control the game via the keyboard:

- Cursorkeys UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT: move your hero.
- with SHIFT: grab or push something in adjacent place without moving yourself.
- ESC: lose a life and restart the level. When game over, returns to title screen.
- Space: pause/continue the game.
- F1: start a new game, or skip popup screen wait.
- F5: cheat and add an extra life.  No highscore will be recorded if you use this.
- F6: cheat and add 10 seconds extra time.   No highscore will be recorded if you use this.
- F7: cheat and skip to the next level.   No highscore will be recorded if you use this.
- F8: randomize colors (only when using Commodore-64 colors)
- F9: replay prerecorded demo (from title screen)
- F12: launch cave editor


## Sound

You can choose between *sampled sounds* and *synthesized sounds* via a command line option.

The sampled sounds require the 'oggdec' tool and the sound files. If you use the 
sound synthesizer however, both of these are not needed at all - all sounds are generated
by the program.

The Python zip app script creates two versions of this game, one with the sound files included,
and another one ()that is much smaller) without the sound files because it uses the synthesizer.

### Hearing no sound? Configure the correct output audio device
On some systems, the lowlevel system audio library seems to report a wrong 
default output audio device. In this case, you may get an ``IOError``
(describing the problem). You can also get another error (or no sound output at all,
without any errors at all...) If this happens, you can configure the output audio device
that should be used:

Either set the ``PY_SYNTHPLAYER_AUDIO_DEVICE`` environment variable to the correct device number,
or set the ``synthplayer.playback.default_audio_device`` parameter at the start of your code.
(The environment variable has priority over the code parameter)

To find the correct device number you can use the command ``python -m sounddevice``.

## How to install and run this game

All platforms: if you just want to *play* the game and are not interested in the code,
you can simply download one of the Python zip apps (*.pyz) files that can be found
on the releases tab. The small one with 'synth' in the name uses synthesized sounds
while the larger one uses sampled sounds. 

If you run the game from a command prompt, you are able to tweak some command line settings.
To see what is available just use the ``-h`` (help) argument.

The original BD1 levels are built-in. With the ``-g`` (game) command line argument you can 
load external level files in BDCFF format. Hundreds of these can be found on 
https://www.boulder-dash.nl/  on the BDCFF format page.  A couple of them are included
in the 'caves' folder.


**Windows**

Did you download only a ```*.pyz``` file? Do this:
1. install Python 3.6 or newer from https://www.python.org/downloads/
1. open a command prompt and type:
   ``pip install --user pillow synthplayer miniaudio"``
   (or use "``sounddevice``" or "``soundcard``" instead of "``miniaudio``" if you prefer another audio api)
1. double-click on the ``*.pyz`` file that you downloaded.

If you downloaded the source code, you can simply launch the game
by clicking on ``startgame-venv.py``  (that should take care of installing the
required libraries for you).  The other script, ``startgame.py`` also works, but
it requires you to have installed the libraries yourself (step 2 above).


**Mac OS, Linux, ...**

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed, with Tkinter (Python's default GUI toolkit).
On Linux it's probably easiest to install these via your distribution's package manager.
On Mac OS, personally I'm using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install things
(I've used the "``brew install python3 --with-tcl-tk``" command to make sure it doesn't use Apple's
own version of the tcl/tk library, which is buggy, but a newer version).

If you don't want to bother with installing the required libraries yourself, 
just launch the ``startgame-venv.py`` script and it will take care of that for you.

Alternatively:

1. make sure you have installed the python libraries: ``pillow``,  ``synthplayer`` and ``miniaudio``
   (or one of the other supported sound libraries). You can often find them in your package manager or install them with pip.
   This can be done easily with ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
1. if you want to play the version with synthesized sounds, you're all set.
1. if you want to play the version with sampled sounds, make sure you're using the ``miniaudio``
   library (which has ogg decoding built in). Otherwise you'll need the external 
   ``oggdec`` tool (usually available as part of the ``vorbis-tools`` package).
1. type ``python3 startgame.py``  or just execute the python zip app ``*.pyz`` file if you
   downloaded that.  If ``python3`` doesn't work just try ``python`` instead.
